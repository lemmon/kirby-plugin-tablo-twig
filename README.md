# Tablo Twig Template

Internal Kirby plugin that swaps Kirbyâ€™s template component to render Twig files alongside PHP. It implements Twig support exactly the way Tablo themes expect, borrowing ideas from the now-abandoned Twig integration by amteich and its maintained fork by wearejust, while remaining a Tablo-specific solution rather than a competitor. If you need a plug-and-play Twig plugin for general Kirby projects, use the Twig Templates plugin from wearejust instead: https://plugins.getkirby.com/wearejust/twig.
