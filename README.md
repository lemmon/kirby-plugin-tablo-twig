# Tablo Twig Template

Internal Kirby plugin that swaps Kirbyâ€™s template component to render Twig files alongside PHP. It implements Twig support exactly the way Tablo themes expect, borrowing ideas from the now-abandoned Twig integration by amteich and its maintained fork by wearejust, while remaining a Tablo-specific solution rather than a competitor. If you need a plug-and-play Twig plugin for general Kirby projects, use the Twig Templates plugin from wearejust instead: https://plugins.getkirby.com/wearejust/twig.

## Install Notes
```sh
# 1. Add the plugin as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/lemmon/kirby-plugin-tablo-twig site/plugins/tablo-twig

# 2. Install Twig runtime for template rendering
composer require twig/twig

# 3. Optional: install Kirby CLI helpers
composer require getkirby/cli
```
